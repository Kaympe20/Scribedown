Make a GitHub README to get a custom sticker
<br /><br />

I'm tired of seeing so many blank GitHub profiles. Profiles need *pizzaz*, they **need** to be *expressive* and say somthing about *you*.
<br>
I challenge you to **fix this by making a nice-looking**, **expressive** profile README.

If you do, I will personally ship you a GitHub sticker with whatever image you want as the background. An example using my profile picture is shown below:

I will also include a Hack Club sticker with that same image as well:

For an example of expressive/unique README's, check out [@NeonGamerBot-QK](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK)'s profile.
